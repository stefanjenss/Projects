# PGA Tour EDA Description:
This exploratory data analysis (EDA) explores the raw data from all Professional Golf Association (PGA) Tour tournaments between the 2015 - 2022 seasons to discover trends and insights into the game of professional golf and which factors might influence a player's success on the tour.

**.csv File Description:**
- PGA_Tour_Raw_Data.csv: this is the original raw data file that I started with.
- pga_clean.csv: this was the final version of all the cleaned data, even with those tournaments missing strokes gained information.
- pga_sg.csv: this file only contained the cleaned data from tournaments in which strokes gained data are available.
- season_2022_exp.csv: this file only contains tournaments from the 2022 season. The file also contains a new variable entitled "course experience," which is based on the previous seven years of experience at a given golf course.
