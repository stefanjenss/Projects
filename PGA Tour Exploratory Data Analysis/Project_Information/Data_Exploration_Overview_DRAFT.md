### 1. **Univariate Analysis**
   This involves looking at each variable individually. For each variable, consider the following:
   - **Quantitative Variables**: 
     - Plot histograms or boxplots to understand distributions.
     - Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, range).
     - Identify any outliers or unusual values.
   - **Categorical Variables**: 
     - Use bar charts or pie charts to see the frequency of categories.
     - Calculate the proportion of each category.

### 2. **Bivariate Analysis**
   Here, you explore the relationship between two variables. This can be done by:
   - Plotting scatter plots for quantitative vs. quantitative variable pairs.
   - Creating grouped bar charts or boxplots for categorical vs. quantitative variables.
   - Using contingency tables or stacked bar charts for categorical vs. categorical variables.

### 3. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Use a correlation matrix and heatmaps to understand the relationships between quantitative variables.
   - Look for high positive or negative correlations that might indicate strong relationships.

### 4. **Missing Data Analysis**
   - Investigate the extent and pattern of missing data.
   - Determine if the missing data is random or has a pattern.

### 5. **Time Series Analysis (if applicable)**
   - If your data has a time component, plot time series graphs to look for trends, seasonality, or cyclical patterns.

### 6. **Identification of Key Variables**
   - Based on your analyses, identify variables that might be key predictors for your modeling phase.
   - Look for variables that show strong relationships with the variable of interest or have significant differences across categories.

### 7. **Textual and Categorical Data Analysis (if applicable)**
   - For textual data, consider frequency analysis or word clouds.
   - For categorical data, investigate the relationship between categories and other variables.

### Tools and Techniques
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and aggregation.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for plotting graphs and visualizations.
- **Scipy** or **Statsmodels** for statistical analyses.

### Recommendations
- Document your findings and observations. This will be valuable for reporting and decision-making in later stages.
- Be open to iterating back to data cleaning if you find issues or new insights during exploration.
